## Project Notes
Some important notes about the project:

- Data preparation was a time-consuming task, as all locations were sent to online maps for validation. If a location matched an existing place, it was marked accordingly. Otherwise, it was classified as "other". Empty entries were labeled as "unknown".

- The performance of the model used in the project was not entirely satisfactory. There are plans to explore and experiment with stronger models in the future.

Feel free to explore the project and its details for a better understanding of the work done during the hackathon.
